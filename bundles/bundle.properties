status.allure-0b-begin.details = [accent]The time to start anew.[]\n\nYou've decided to accept the distress call recieved on Serpulo. The species has chosen to lend you their available technology, to make this endeavour possible. Use it wisely.\nFurther technology of these [#7382f0]energy-based[] systems lie about on this world, awaiting retrieval.
status.allure-0b-basic-infrastructure.name = Basic Infrastructure
status.allure-0b-basic-infrastructure.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nYou've figured out how to construct basic factories without need of existing blueprints. [#7382f0]Use this to expand your outposts[], and to begin your training on the other technologies.
status.allure-0b-energy-weaponry.name = Energy Weaponry
status.allure-0b-energy-weaponry.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nYou have gained knowledge of the usage of [#7382f0]energy-based, or thenon, weaponry[]. This weapony seems to be [#7382f0]more effective against certain enemies[], and less against others.\n\nAlthough the weapons and defenses provided by this basic knowledge are limited, your database can be expanded. Further knowledge, however, requires the data cards found in [accent]Forge Plating[].
status.allure-0b-electromagnetic-acceleration.name = Electromagnetic Acceleration
status.allure-0b-electromagnetic-acceleration.details = The careful application of data cards has led you to the knowledge of high-output electromagnetic coils. This has allowed the Warden people to design railgun blueprints for your tactical use.\nRailguns have [#7382f0]high hit damage[] and a low rate of fire, but [#e65555]deal far less energy damage[].\n\n[#e65555]Railguns are the least effective against armored targets.[]
status.allure-0b-shock-weaponry.name = Shock Weaponry
status.allure-0b-shock-weaponry.details = The data cards have revealed the basic information around unguided, violent thenon arcs. These arcs do not absorb into the ground immediately, instead dissipating into the air over a long distance.\n\nArcing weapons deal [#7382f0]massively high energy damage[] but deal [#e65555]miniscule hit damage[]. Arcs deal far more damage closer to the release point.
status.allure-0b-emp-weaponry.name = EMP Weaponry
status.allure-0b-emp-weaponry.details = Further data on thenon arcs reveal their ability to release massive pulses of electromagnetic radiation. This effect is [#e65555]limited in range and effect[], only applying to the strongest bolts of massive thenon blasts.\n\nThis huge shock can [#7382f0]entirely disable enemy structures and units[], and [#7382f0] instantly downs vulnerable air targets[].\n\n[#e65555]However, some enemies unaffected by energy damage and any enemies using other means of operation are immune to EMPs.[]

status.allure-0b-flare-weaponry.name = Plasma Flare Weaponry
status.allure-0b-flare-weaponry.details = Spare data cards have led you to the discovery of plasma lances. These incredibly powerful weapons vapourize and ablate their targets, dealing heavy damage or reducing their resistance to direct damage.\n\nPlasma lances apply [#db661c]thermal damage[] to enemies that [#7382f0]significantly increase damage dealt by hitting weapons[].\n\n[#db661c]Differing tiers of thermal damage can be applied simultaneously, decreasing enemy damage resistance further.[]
status.allure-0b-rapid-fire-plasma.name = Rapid-Fire Plasma
status.allure-0b-rapid-fire-plasma.details = The data cards have led you to the ability to launch magnetic containment spheres, filled with thenon plasma.

status.allure-0b-energy-defense.name = Energy Defenses
status.allure-0b-energy-defense.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nFinally, you have explored the ability to defend with controlled thenon plasma. This allows you to create shields, [#7382f0]which will be your main defense[].\n\nThenon shields can be created in several sizes, allowing for diverse application. Thenon shields [#7382f0]can also be regenerated, and their damage resistance increased[]. Thenon shields, however, are rather weak without such additions.\nThenon shields innately regenerate at a slow rate over time.\n\n[#e65555]Thenon shields will not defend against lasers, and lightning will cause damage to the projector if no insulators are used.[]
status.allure-0b-barrier-weaponry.details = The best of both worlds. Playing around with energy control has allowed you to create [#7382f0]weapons that shoot defenses.[]\n\nBarrier weaponry [#7382f0]pushes hostile units back[] and [#7382f0]absorbs bullets.[]
status.allure-0b-steam-heating.name = Steam Heating
status.allure-0b-steam-heating.details = While dangerously messing around with heat conductivity and steam boilers, you discovered how to [#7382f0]boil water in large quantities.[]\nSteam seems to be very important for later [#7382f0]turbine-using structures.[]
status.allure-0b-condenser-turbines.name = Condenser Turbines
status.allure-0b-condenser-turbines.details = You managed to hook a water condenser and a better shaft to your turbines, allowing [#7382f0]water to recirculate[] back to your heaters.
status.allure-0b-guided-plasma-weaponry.name = Guided Plasma Weaponry
status.allure-0b-guided-plasma-weaponry.details = Data on the data cards have revealed specifics of using magnetics to attract plasma containment spheres. Due to the lack of sufficient data on more refined containment, these spheres cannot be fired rapidly from a single direction. However, [#7382f0]these spheres will curve toward enemies[], often making up for their angle by impacting the target nonetheless.\n\nPlasma missles deal [#7382f0]large amounts of hit and energy damage[]. However, many plasma missiles [#e65555]will miss if the target is too close[].\n\n[#7382f0]Plasma missiles have a very long range.
status.allure-0b-wormhole-beacons.name = Wormhole Beacons
status.allure-0b-wormhole-beacons.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nAfter attempting to upgrade your Nexus' antenna, you managed to instead create an [#7382f0]interdimensional broadcast antenna.[]\n\nThese antennae can be used to [#7382f0]call in warden reinforcements[], with different broadcasting frequency meshes calling in different starships.\nCoolant for such a broadcast is hard to integrate, leading to antennae [#e65555]overheating after a single use.[] 
status.allure-0b-fleet-beacons.name = Fleet Beacons
status.allure-0b-fleet-beacons.details = With some work, and some analysis of high-capacity coolant systems, you have managed to find a way to [#7382f0]cool simpler beacons[] and allow repeated broadcasts.\n\nYou can now [#7382f0]call in full fleets of smaller starships[], or [#7382f0]reliably call in more combat-capable warships.[]\n\n\n\nJust don't spam Entulae's DMs.
status.allure-0b-payload-launching.name = Payload Launching 
status.allure-0b-payload-launching.details = Data cards have led you to the finding of launching [#7382f0]high-capacity capsules across long distances[]. These energia-powered cannons and their belts can transport massive amounts of resources quickly.\n\nPayload tech also seems to have [#7382f0]use in specific larger scale weaponry[].
status.allure-0b-advanced-production.name = Advanced Production
status.allure-0b-advanced-production.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\n[#7382f0]The species has transferred over blueprints for many larger structures.[]\n\nThese huge structures produce the final materials you'll need to claim victory over the toughest enemies. Use them wisely, and keep their requirements in mind.\n\n[#e65555]Don't break our trust.[]
status.allure-industrial-blast-furnace.name = Industrial Blast Furnace
